The code is written on Arduino IDE in C++.
The code uses Djikstra's Algorithm to traverse through a given maze and pass through particular checkpoints.
#
There are 2 modes in the code:
1) Dry-run and 2) Main-run
#
Dry-run involves traversing through all nodes in the maze and marking the white(tractable), black(non-tractable) nodes and important checkpoints.
#
Main-run involves passing throught the shortest path calculated using Djikstra's Algorithm and carry out the tasks of Image processing ang gripping of objects.
